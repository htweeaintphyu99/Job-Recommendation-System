# Job-Recommendation-System
This is an AI project that our team of two did at start-up company. The algorithm is to find the most relevant resumes from the user's keywords. For example, when there is a database of multiple resumes and when a user search a particular keyword, the functions returns lists of resumes that are the most related. The code is optimized for search speed as well.
